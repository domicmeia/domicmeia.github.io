## Interview Questions

---

## 1. 직무 이해도

### What is the Role of Data Center Technician?

Data Center Technician is responsible for the maintenace, troubleshooting, and repair of hardware and infrastructure in a data center. They ensure the uninterrupted operation of servers and associated equipment.

### Can you provide an example of a preventive maintenacne task in a deta center?

Regularly cleaning server components to prevent dust buildup and checking for loose cables are essential preventive maintenance tasks. They help in preventing potential hardware issues.

## 2. 트러블 슈팅

### How do you handle hardware failures in a data center?

I follow these steps:

1. Identify the failed componet using monitoring tools.
2. Replace the faulty hardware with a spare.
3. Perform necessary tests to ensure proper functioning.
4. Update records and documentation.

### What is the purpose of a remote hands service in a data center?

Remote hands service allows for troubleshooting, maintenace, and physical tasks to be performed by off-site technicians. This is crucial for efficiency and quick response to issues.

### How do you conduct a risk assessment in a data center environment?

I identify potential risk such as power failures, network issues, and hardware failures. Then, I evaluate their impact and likelihood, and implement measures to mitigate or minimize them.

### How do you handle a situation where a critical server fails to boot?

I first check for loose connections of faulty components. If needed, I would boot from a recovery disk or perform troubleshooting steps specific to the server's hardware.

### How do you handle a situation where a data center is at risk of flooding?

I ensure critical equipment is elevated, implement waterproofing measures, and establish protocols for shutting down non-essential systems. Additionally, I monior weater alerts an have a disaster recovery plan in place.

### How do you prioritize tasks when multiple critical issues aires simultaneously?

I assess the impact and urgency of each issue. Critical systems with the highest impact and urgency are addressed first, followed by less critical tasks.

### Explain the purpose of a DCA(Data Center Interconnect) in a multi-data center environment.

A DCI links multiple data centers, allowing them to operate as a single unit. It enables seamless data replication, load balancing, and disaster recovery across geographically distributed facilities.

### Explain the role of a UPS(Uninterruptible Power Supply) in a data center.

A UPS provides temporary power during electrical outages. It ensures a smooth transition to backup generators, preventing any interruption to critical systems.

### Explain the purpose of a RPS(Redundant Power Supply) in a data center.

A RPS ensures uninterrupted power to critical equipment in case of a primary power source failure. It adds an extra layer of reliability and minimizes downtime.

### Expalin the concept of Hot and Cold Aisles in a data center. 

In a hot aisle/cold aisle layout, servers are arranged so that cold air is directed into the front of the servers(cold aisle) and hot air is expelled out the back(hot aisle). This improves cooling efficiency.

### Explain the role of RAID(Redundant Array of Independent Disks)

RAID combines multiple hard drives to improve performance, reliability, and redundancy. Different RAID levels offer varying degrees of data protection and speed.

### Explain the purpose of PDU(Power Distribution Unit) in a data center.

A PDU distributes electrical power to servers and networking equipment within a rack. It provides multiple outlets, allowing for efficient power management and load balancing.

A SAN provides high-speed, block-level access to storage resources, allowing servers to access shared storage devices. It is used for critical applications and data requiring high availavility.

### Explain the purpose of a Network Switch in a data center.

A Network switch connects multiple devices within a network, allowing them to communicate efficiently. It operates at the data link layer of the OSI model, improving network performance.

### Explain the purpose of an ILO(Integrated Lights-Out) in a data center.

ILO is a remote management interface that allows administrators to monitor and manage servers even if the operating system is not running. It provides out-of-band management capabilities.

### Explain the purpose of a Blade Server in a data center.

A blade server is a compact, modular server that shares resources with other blade servers. It reduces the physical footprint, simplifies management, and enhances scalabiltiy in a data center.

### Explain the purpose of a console server in a data center.

A console server provides out-of-band access to network devices and servers. It allows administartors to manage and troubleshoot equipment even if the network is down.

### Explain the purpose of a storage array in data center.

A storage array is a centralized storage system that provides high-capacity storage for servers. It allows for scalable and shared storage resources, enhancing data management capabilties.

### Explain the purpose of a NIC(Network Interface Card) in a data center.

A NIC is a hardware component that connects a server to a network. It enables communication between the server and other devices, allowing data transfer over the network.

### Explain the purpose of a firewall in a data center.

A firewall is a security device that filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on an applied rule set. It acts as a barrier between a trusted network and untrusted networks(like the internet), preventing unauthorized access and potential threats.
